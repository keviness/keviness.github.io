        <h3>Never Waste Your Time</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;Imagine your life is prefect in every aspect, what would 
            it look like?
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Unless you're willing to accept average or mediocrity, then 
            this is one thing that you're going to have to do in order for you 
            to have what you truly want.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Keep going and never quit, It is hard being a high-performance 
            person. I know, But is it rewarding and worth it?<br/>
            &emsp;Yes, It is, So do what you have to do now?
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Do not procrastinate, Don't quit, Don't push it to sometime 
            later, There is never an easy time to make a hard decision, Do it now.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;In the military, you're told that time costs lives, In the coorperate 
            world, you're told time costs money, I tell you time costs everything, 
            Your dreams, Your goals, Your aspiration, they require your time.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Each moment you stay stagnant instead of doing the things 
            you know you should be doing today so that you can be where you want to be 
            tomorrow, you shift your goals by a few months or even years.
        </p>
            &emsp;Times costs everything, so don't waste it doing nothing. 
            Use it to what needs to be done.<be/>
            &emsp;Don't quit at all!
