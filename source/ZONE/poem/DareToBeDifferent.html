        <p>&emsp;Two kids were asked to carry out a task. but before doing so 
            they were told several before them had tired but failed. The first 
            kid said, well, if many had failed, I can't guarantee mine will be any 
            different, but I shall try.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;The second kid, however, said I don't care how many have failed 
            before me. They are not me. I'm different from the test.
