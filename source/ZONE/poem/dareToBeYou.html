    <h3>Dare to be you</h3>
    <p>&emsp;I see your big heart.

    </p>
    <p>&emsp;Never afraid to be you. The real you, That's the best 
        you and the only you anyone needs to know.
    </p>
    <p>&emsp;Someone won't like it. They're not meant for you. 
        Someone will love it, Those are you people. Anyone that doesn't love 
        the real you, is not meant for you. 
        Keep giving you all, to everyone. shine bright, like the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;I see you, I see you don't fit it, I see you're different, 
        but you will find your place, I see you're different and what
         a blessing 
        that is!
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;Don't settle for people who dim your light, wait for those 
        who light you up. 
        Wait for the spark, wait for the magic. The right people will 
        show up in your life, if you're patient and true to youself.
    </p>
    <p>

        important.
    </p>
    <p>
