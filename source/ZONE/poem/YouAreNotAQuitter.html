        <h3>You are not a quitter</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;Falling down is an accident, but staying down is a choice. 
            It's okay to fail, It's okay to fall, It's okay to lose. 
            But it is not okay to quit, It is not okay to give up, It's not okay.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;You are better than that, you are not a quitter. 
            You have more within you to give. this can't be it. 
            Are you a victim? or a victor? Which one is it going to be? 
            It's not okay to quit. It's not okay. You are better than that, 
            You are not a quitter. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Don't stop because of failures. Don't quit because it is getting 
            hard. Success comes at a price. I am not ready to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;This is not where my journey ends, This is where my 
            journey begins. This is where I fight back. This is where I make 
            my stand.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Make a stand, make a stand for youself in your dreams. 
            You are bigger and better than any losses you have had. 
            You are smarter and stronger than any defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;You will learn and you will come back for more, because 
            you are relentless!
