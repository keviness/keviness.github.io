        <h3>Surround Yourself with Friendship</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;From today, tell yourself, I have everything I need within 
            myself. The only approval I'll ever need is mine.<br/>
            &emsp;I choose to stop apologizing for being me. I have the power to 
            change my world. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Now I must warn you that when you make a decision to be different, 
            it won't all be rosy. You would lose some friends. Many will not go on 
            this journey of acting out the normal with you. Some will reprimand 
            you and drain you. But that's fine, Because not everyone is suppose 
            to walk with you through this journey called life.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;In everything you do, It's important that you surround 
            yourself with the rigth kind of friendship. Things are never 
            quite as scary when you have real friends.<br/>
            &emsp;And setting yourself apart attracts that kind of friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Those friends who make your problems their problems, 
            just so you don't have to go through them alone.
